# Track Suggester

#### This is a webpage designed to help you find the right programming language for you.

#### By Drew Tucker

## Description

This webpage was designed to help up-and-coming students to decide which programming track/language would be the best for them to learn, based on a couple questions such as Front-end or Back-end preference, company size, and the size of the project itself. It records the user's name and displays a personalized message back to them with a suggestion. This was an exercise in Javascript and JQuery.
